# What's this?

We're using this repository to setup a public profile page, cf. the [Tudat Team overview page](https://github.com/tudat-team). For more info, refer to [How to Use the .github Repository](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-the-dot-github-repository/).

Additional uses for the `.github` repository are to setup *community health files* (from [Creating a default community health file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)):

- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**: A CODE_OF_CONDUCT file defines standards for how to engage in a community. For more information, see "Adding a code of conduct to your project."
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**:	A CONTRIBUTING file communicates how people should contribute to your project. For more information, see "Setting guidelines for repository contributors."
- **FUNDING.yml**:	A FUNDING file displays a sponsor button in your repository to increase the visibility of funding options for your open source project. For more information, see "Displaying a sponsor button in your repository."
Issue and pull request templates and config.yml	Issue and pull request templates customize and standardize the information you'd like contributors to include when they open issues and pull requests in your repository. For more information, see "About issue and pull request templates."
- **SECURITY.md**:	A SECURITY file gives instructions for how to report a security vulnerability in your project. For more information, see "Adding a security policy to your repository."
- **SUPPORT.md**:	A SUPPORT file lets people know about ways to get help with your project. For more information, see "Adding support resources to your project."

It is unclear at this point if Tudat-team will take advantage of all of these capabilities.
