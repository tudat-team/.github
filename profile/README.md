This is the Github landing page for the TU Delft Astrodynamics Toolkit - or Tudat - project. Tudat is a powerfull toolbox for research and education in numerical orbit propagation, state and parameter estimation, and mission design. The project originated at, and is managed by, staff and students at TU Delft, with an ever growing network of users, developers and alumni. The bulk of the functionality is written in C++ (Tudat), but the typical user interface is in Python (Tudatpy), which links to the core code using the pybind11 software.

Below you'll find a list of all the repositories relevant to our project. However, our main documentation pages are:
- [The Tudat website](https://docs.tudat.space/en/latest/) where you can find installation instructions, examples, overview of functionalities, and more!
- [The Tudat API reference](https://py.api.tudat.space/en/latest/), where a comprehensive overview of the user interfaces can be found.
- [The Tudat developer documentation](https://tudat-developer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), where details on how Tudat and the ecosystem around it is put together.
