<!-- ## Hi there 👋 -->

## Welcome <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

We are a group of students, academics, educators, and enthusiasts providing access to, while maintaining, a powerful toolkit: the TU Delft Astrodynamics Toolkit (Tudat), with a mission of fuelling careers and passions in astrodynamics and space.

## 🌈 Contribution guidelines

We currently have no strict guidelines to contributions as we are a relatively small group of enthusiasts with numerous members transitioning in and out of the team during their M.Sc. in Space Flight at TU Delft. There are however long-term members consisting of Alumni, PhD students, PhD candidates, and professors.

## 👩‍💻 Useful resources

[Tudat Space](https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is the central hub of our documentation.

## 🍿 Fun facts

We believe that if there's a Hell, CMake belongs there.
